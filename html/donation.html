            The main motto of our group is to tackle all the problems which are faced by people living in under
            developed countries such as Mozambique,
            Liberia, Mali, Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone, Burundi, Chad, South Sudan, Central African Republic, Niger and
            many more. Most of these listed countries are not even know to majority of people.
            Why so? Why so far there has not been any institution which could make a significant difference in uplifting
            them? With the vision to provide basic necessties to all, our President has kept pushing himself to do
            whatever it takes to help those in need.
